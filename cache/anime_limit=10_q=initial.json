The only way the Speed Stars can stand a chance against them is if they can get the panda-colored AE86 to join their team. With a bit of coercion, Takumi takes the wheel of the AE86 and heads off to Mount Akina to defend the pride of all racers in Akina.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "New Initial D Movie: Legend 1 - Kakusei was released on Blu-ray and DVD by Sentai Filmworks on December 5, 2017.", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 109, "type": "anime", "name": "Shochiku", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/109/Shochiku"}, {"mal_id": 159, "type": "anime", "name": "Kodansha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"}, {"mal_id": 539, "type": "anime", "name": "Ultra Super Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/539/Ultra_Super_Pictures"}, {"mal_id": 1284, "type": "anime", "name": "Avex Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1284/Avex_Pictures"}, {"mal_id": 1345, "type": "anime", "name": "Sammy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1345/Sammy"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 537, "type": "anime", "name": "SANZIGEN", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/537/SANZIGEN"}, {"mal_id": 839, "type": "anime", "name": "LIDENFILMS", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/839/LIDENFILMS"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 3, "type": "anime", "name": "Racing", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/3/Racing"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]}, {"mal_id": 28881, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/28881/New_Initial_D_Movie__Legend_2_-_Tousou", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/72246.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/72246t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/72246l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/72246.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/72246t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/72246l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": "https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9py2OnojPz4?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "New Initial D Movie: Legend 2 - Tousou"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Shin Gekijouban Initial D: Legend 2 - Tousou"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u65b0\u5287\u5834\u7248\u3000\u982d\u6587\u5b57\uff3b\u30a4\u30cb\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\uff3dD Legend2 -\u95d8\u8d70-"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Initial D Legend 2 Racer"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Initial D Film 2: Legend 2"}], "title": "New Initial D Movie: Legend 2 - Tousou", "title_english": "Initial D Legend 2 Racer", "title_japanese": "\u65b0\u5287\u5834\u7248\u3000\u982d\u6587\u5b57\uff3b\u30a4\u30cb\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\uff3dD Legend2 -\u95d8\u8d70-", "title_synonyms": ["Shin Gekijouban Initial D: Legend 2 - Tousou"], "type": "Movie", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2015-05-23T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 23, "month": 5, "year": 2015}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "May 23, 2015"}, "duration": "1 hr 1 min", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.82, "scored_by": 28724, "rank": 1060, "popularity": 3613, "members": 47646, "favorites": 49, "synopsis": "After witnessing the race between Takumi Fujiwara's Toyota AE86 and Keisuke Takahashi's Mazda RX7, Takeshi Nakazato from the Myougi Night Kids sends out a challenge to defeat the AE86 in a downhill battle.
