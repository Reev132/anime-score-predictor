Sword Art Online (SAO), one of the most recent games on the console, offers a gateway into the wondrous world of Aincrad, a vivid, medieval landscape where users can do anything within the limits of imagination. With the release of this worldwide sensation, gaming has never felt more lifelike.\n\nHowever, the idyllic fantasy rapidly becomes a brutal nightmare when SAO's creator traps thousands of players inside the game. The \"log-out\" function has been removed, with the only method of escape involving beating all of Aincrad's one hundred increasingly difficult levels. Adding to the struggle, any in-game death becomes permanent, ending the player's life in the real world.\n\nWhile Kazuto \"Kirito\" Kirigaya was fortunate enough to be a beta-tester for the game, he quickly finds that despite his advantages, he cannot overcome SAO's challenges alone. Teaming up with Asuna Yuuki and other talented players, Kirito makes an effort to face the seemingly insurmountable trials head-on. But with difficult bosses and threatening dark cults impeding his progress, Kirito finds that such tasks are much easier said than done.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "summer", "year": 2012, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "00:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 00:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}, {"mal_id": 79, "type": "anime", "name": "Genco", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/79/Genco"}, {"mal_id": 315, "type": "anime", "name": "DAX Production", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/315/DAX_Production"}, {"mal_id": 681, "type": "anime", "name": "ASCII Media Works", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/681/ASCII_Media_Works"}, {"mal_id": 1097, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Namco Games", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1097/Bandai_Namco_Games"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 493, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex of America", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/493/Aniplex_of_America"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 56, "type": "anime", "name": "A-1 Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/56/A-1_Pictures"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 79, "type": "anime", "name": "Video Game", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/79/Video_Game"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 37278, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/37278/Sword_Art_Online_Fatal_Bullet__The_Third_Episode_-_Pilot-ban", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1821/90470.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1821/90470t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1821/90470l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1821/90470.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1821/90470t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1821/90470l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Sword Art Online Fatal Bullet: The Third Episode - Pilot-ban"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "Sword Art Online Fatal Bullet -The Third Episode- \uff1c\u30d1\u30a4\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u7248\uff1e"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Sword Art Online Fatal Bullet: The Third Episode - Pilot"}], "title": "Sword Art Online Fatal Bullet: The Third Episode - Pilot-ban", "title_english": "Sword Art Online Fatal Bullet: The Third Episode - Pilot", "title_japanese": "Sword Art Online Fatal Bullet -The Third Episode- \uff1c\u30d1\u30a4\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u7248\uff1e", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "ONA", "source": "Game", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2018-02-08T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 8, "month": 2, "year": 2018}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Feb 8, 2018"}, "duration": "3 min", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 5.93, "scored_by": 5041, "rank": 10793, "popularity": 5724, "members": 17269, "favorites": 42, "synopsis": "A special movie said to be inspired by the Sword Art Online Fatal Bullet video game.

Feeling insecure about the people at the Axiom Church, Alice brings the unconscious Kirito back to their hometown\u2014Rulid Village, disregarding her banishment due to an unabsolved crime. Now, Alice is living an ordinary and peaceful life close by the village, wishing for Kirito to wake up.\n\nHowever, tragedy strikes when Alice notices that the Dark Territory has already started to invade the Human Empire. Reassuming her previous alias, Alice Synthesis Thirty, she promises to defeat the Dark Territory in order to defend the world that Kirito and Eugeo worked so hard to protect.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Sword Art Online: Alicization - War of Underworld is an adaptation of volumes 15 through 18 of Reki Kawahara's Sword Art Online light novel series.", "season": "fall", "year": 2019, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "00:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 00:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}, {"mal_id": 1233, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Namco Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1233/Bandai_Namco_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 1444, "type": "anime", "name": "Egg Firm", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1444/Egg_Firm"}, {"mal_id": 1683, "type": "anime", "name": "Straight Edge", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1683/Straight_Edge"}, {"mal_id": 1696, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}, {"mal_id": 1858, "type": "anime", "name": "Sonilude", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1858/Sonilude"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 493, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex of America", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/493/Aniplex_of_America"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 56, "type": "anime", "name": "A-1 Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/56/A-1_Pictures"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 79, "type": "anime", "name": "Video Game", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/79/Video_Game"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 31765, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/31765/Sword_Art_Online_Movie__Ordinal_Scale", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1557/123313.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1557/123313t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1557/123313l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1557/123313.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1557/123313t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1557/123313l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": "https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/32FLqOWjUfI?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Sword Art Online Movie: Ordinal Scale"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Gekijouban Sword Art Online"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u5287\u5834\u7248 \u30bd\u30fc\u30c9\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u30fb\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3 -\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30ca\u30eb\u30fb\u30b9\u30b1\u30fc\u30eb-"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Sword Art Online the Movie: Ordinal Scale"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Sword Art Online: Ordinal Scale The Movie"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Sword Art Online, la Pel\u00edcula: Ordinal Scale"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Sword Art Online The Movie: Ordinal Scale"}], "title": "Sword Art Online Movie: Ordinal Scale", "title_english": "Sword Art Online the Movie: Ordinal Scale", "title_japanese": "\u5287\u5834\u7248 \u30bd\u30fc\u30c9\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u30fb\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3 -\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30ca\u30eb\u30fb\u30b9\u30b1\u30fc\u30eb-", "title_synonyms": ["Gekijouban Sword Art Online"], "type": "Movie", "source": "Original", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2017-02-18T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 18, "month": 2, "year": 2017}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Feb 18, 2017"}, "duration": "1 hr 59 min", "rating": "R+ - Mild Nudity", "score": 7.56, "scored_by": 477341, "rank": 1826, "popularity": 291, "members": 772281, "favorites": 3504, "synopsis": "In 2026, four years after the infamous Sword Art Online incident, a revolutionary new form of technology has emerged: the Augma, a device that utilizes an Augmented Reality system.
