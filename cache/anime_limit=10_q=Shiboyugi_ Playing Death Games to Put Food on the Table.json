Six years after his debut, his boss fears that Fable has started to attract too much attention from the legal authorities, and he orders him to hide in Osaka for a year. Accompanied by his driver who assumes the identity of his sister, Fable is bound by a special condition: he must act as a civilian and not murder anyone lest he and his partner lose their lives.\n\nHowever, the seemingly well-deserved holiday soon takes a grim turn. Takeshi Ebihara, the second-in-command of the Osaka mafia that officially protects the assassin, sees Fable's presence as a threat and wants to remove him. Constantly monitored by the yakuza and regularly put in life-or-death situations, Fable has no other choice but to outwit Takeshi's schemes if he wants to stay alive.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2024, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "00:55", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 00:55 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 29, "type": "anime", "name": "VAP", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/29/VAP"}, {"mal_id": 159, "type": "anime", "name": "Kodansha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"}, {"mal_id": 1003, "type": "anime", "name": "Nippon Television Network", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1003/Nippon_Television_Network"}, {"mal_id": 1506, "type": "anime", "name": "Audio Planning U", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1506/Audio_Planning_U"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 200, "type": "anime", "name": "Tezuka Productions", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/200/Tezuka_Productions"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 41, "type": "anime", "name": "Suspense", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/41/Suspense"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 50, "type": "anime", "name": "Adult Cast", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"}, {"mal_id": 68, "type": "anime", "name": "Organized Crime", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/68/Organized_Crime"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]}]}
