With the release of this worldwide sensation, gaming has never felt more lifelike.\n\nHowever, the idyllic fantasy rapidly becomes a brutal nightmare when SAO's creator traps thousands of players inside the game. The \"log-out\" function has been removed, with the only method of escape involving beating all of Aincrad's one hundred increasingly difficult levels. Adding to the struggle, any in-game death becomes permanent, ending the player's life in the real world.\n\nWhile Kazuto \"Kirito\" Kirigaya was fortunate enough to be a beta-tester for the game, he quickly finds that despite his advantages, he cannot overcome SAO's challenges alone. Teaming up with Asuna Yuuki and other talented players, Kirito makes an effort to face the seemingly insurmountable trials head-on. But with difficult bosses and threatening dark cults impeding his progress, Kirito finds that such tasks are much easier said than done.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "summer", "year": 2012, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "00:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 00:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}, {"mal_id": 79, "type": "anime", "name": "Genco", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/79/Genco"}, {"mal_id": 315, "type": "anime", "name": "DAX Production", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/315/DAX_Production"}, {"mal_id": 681, "type": "anime", "name": "ASCII Media Works", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/681/ASCII_Media_Works"}, {"mal_id": 1097, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Namco Games", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1097/Bandai_Namco_Games"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 493, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex of America", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/493/Aniplex_of_America"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 56, "type": "anime", "name": "A-1 Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/56/A-1_Pictures"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 79, "type": "anime", "name": "Video Game", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/79/Video_Game"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 36474, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/36474/Sword_Art_Online__Alicization", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1993/93837.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1993/93837t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1993/93837l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1993/93837.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1993/93837t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1993/93837l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": "https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W_XoPy-VNt0?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Sword Art Online: Alicization"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Sword Art Online III"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "SAO Alicization"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Sword Art Online 3"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "SAO 3"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30bd\u30fc\u30c9\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u30fb\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3 \u30a2\u30ea\u30b7\u30bc\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Sword Art Online: Alicization"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Sword Art Online Alicization"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Sword Art Online Alicization"}], "title": "Sword Art Online: Alicization", "title_english": "Sword Art Online: Alicization", "title_japanese": "\u30bd\u30fc\u30c9\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u30fb\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3 \u30a2\u30ea\u30b7\u30bc\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "title_synonyms": ["Sword Art Online III", "SAO Alicization", "Sword Art Online 3", "SAO 3"], "type": "TV", "source": "Light novel", "episodes": 24, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2018-10-07T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2019-03-31T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 7, "month": 10, "year": 2018}, "to": {"day": 31, "month": 3, "year": 2019}}, "string": "Oct 7, 2018 to Mar 31, 2019"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "R - 17+ (violence & profanity)", "score": 7.57, "scored_by": 667059, "rank": 1783, "popularity": 149, "members": 1127917, "favorites": 7573, "synopsis": "The Soul Translator is a state-of-the-art full-dive interface which interacts with the user's Fluctlight\u2014the technological equivalent of a human soul\u2014and fundamentally differs from the orthodox method of sending signals to the brain.

What will the girls get up to in the pool, and what awaits Kirito and his \"counseling\"?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 493, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex of America", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/493/Aniplex_of_America"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 56, "type": "anime", "name": "A-1 Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/56/A-1_Pictures"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 79, "type": "anime", "name": "Video Game", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/79/Video_Game"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 21881, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/21881/Sword_Art_Online_II", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1223/121999.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1223/121999t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1223/121999l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1223/121999.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1223/121999t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1223/121999l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": "https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tdvsWRjh224?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Sword Art Online II"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Phantom Bullet"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "SAO II"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Sword Art Online 2"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "SAO 2"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30bd\u30fc\u30c9\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u30fb\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3 II"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Sword Art Online II"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Sword Art Online \u2161"}], "title": "Sword Art Online II", "title_english": "Sword Art Online II", "title_japanese": "\u30bd\u30fc\u30c9\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u30fb\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3 II", "title_synonyms": ["Phantom Bullet", "SAO II", "Sword Art Online 2", "SAO 2"], "type": "TV", "source": "Light novel", "episodes": 24, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2014-07-05T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2014-12-20T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 5, "month": 7, "year": 2014}, "to": {"day": 20, "month": 12, "year": 2014}}, "string": "Jul 5, 2014 to Dec 20, 2014"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.72, "scored_by": 1398751, "rank": 6086, "popularity": 40, "members": 2089746, "favorites": 9529, "synopsis": "A year after escaping Sword Art Online, Kazuto Kirigaya has been settling back into the real world. However, his peace is short-lived as a new incident occurs in a game called Gun Gale Online, where a player by the name of Death Gun appears to be killing people in the real world by shooting them in-game. Approached by officials to assist in investigating the murders, Kazuto assumes his persona of Kirito once again and logs into Gun Gale Online, intent on stopping the killer.\n\nOnce inside, Kirito meets Sinon, a highly skilled sniper afflicted by a traumatic past. She is soon dragged in his chase after Death Gun, and together they enter the Bullet of Bullets, a tournament where their target is sure to appear. Uncertain of Death Gun's real powers, Kirito and Sinon race to stop him before he has the chance to claim another life. Not everything goes smoothly, however, as scars from the past impede their progress. In a high-stakes game where the next victim could easily be one of them, Kirito puts his life on the line in the virtual world once more.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Sword Art Online II adapts novels 5 to 8 of Reki Kawahara's light novel series of the same title.", "season": "summer", "year": 2014, "broadcast": {"day": "Saturdays", "time": "23:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Saturdays at 23:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}, {"mal_id": 79, "type": "anime", "name": "Genco", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/79/Genco"}, {"mal_id": 681, "type": "anime", "name": "ASCII Media Works", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/681/ASCII_Media_Works"}, {"mal_id": 1097, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Namco Games", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1097/Bandai_Namco_Games"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 493, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex of America", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/493/Aniplex_of_America"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 56, "type": "anime", "name": "A-1 Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/56/A-1_Pictures"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 79, "type": "anime", "name": "Video Game", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/79/Video_Game"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 27891, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/27891/Sword_Art_Online_II__Debriefing", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/67587.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/67587t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/67587l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/67587.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/67587t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/67587l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Sword Art Online II: Debriefing"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Sword Art Online II Episode 14.5"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Sword Art Online II Recap"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "SAO 2 Recap"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30bd\u30fc\u30c9\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u30fb\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3 II"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Sword Art Online II: Debriefing"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Sword Art Online Staffel 2"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Sword Art Online Temporada 2"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Sword Art Online Saison 2"}], "title": "Sword Art Online II: Debriefing", "title_english": "Sword Art Online II: Debriefing", "title_japanese": "\u30bd\u30fc\u30c9\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u30fb\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3 II", "title_synonyms": ["Sword Art Online II Episode 14.5", "Sword Art Online II Recap", "SAO 2 Recap"], "type": "TV Special", "source": "Light novel", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2014-10-11T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 11, "month": 10, "year": 2014}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Oct 11, 2014"}, "duration": "24 min", "rating": "PG-13 -
