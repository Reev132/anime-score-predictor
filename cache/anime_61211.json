Years then passed, and Arisu is now a second-year high-schooler. He makes it his mission to search for Apollo, as there is something he wants to tell her. He doesn't know what she looks like, or even what her real name is, but he manages to get some leads on her in his school's broadcasting club. That's where he meets four girls who all dream to get a job where they can make full use of their voices! Just who is Apollo, and how will those four's dreams pan out?\n\n(Source: Kodansha USA)", "background": "Mayonaka Heart Tune aired on Kansai TV and Fuji TV's Ka-Anival!! block.", "season": "winter", "year": 2026, "broadcast": {"day": "Tuesdays", "time": "23:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Tuesdays at 23:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 159, "type": "anime", "name": "Kodansha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"}, {"mal_id": 460, "type": "anime", "name": "KlockWorx", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/460/KlockWorx"}, {"mal_id": 1113, "type": "anime", "name": "NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1113/NBCUniversal_Entertainment_Japan"}, {"mal_id": 1284, "type": "anime", "name": "Avex Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1284/Avex_Pictures"}, {"mal_id": 1345, "type": "anime", "name": "Sammy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1345/Sammy"}, {"mal_id": 1412, "type": "anime", "name": "Kansai TV", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1412/Kansai_TV"}, {"mal_id": 1468, "type": "anime", "name": "Crunchyroll", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1468/Crunchyroll"}, {"mal_id": 2185, "type": "anime", "name": "BS Asahi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2185/BS_Asahi"}, {"mal_id": 2640, "type": "anime", "name": "INSPION Edge", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2640/INSPION_Edge"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 2554, "type": "anime", "name": "Gekkou", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2554/Gekkou"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 35, "type": "anime", "name": "Harem", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/35/Harem"}, {"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}, {"mal_id": 75, "type": "anime", "name": "Showbiz", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/75/Showbiz"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}}
