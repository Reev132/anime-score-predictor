Even so, laid-back Lizel isn't the type to panic. He immediately sets out to learn more about this strange place, and to help him do so, hires a seasoned adventurer named Gil as his tour guide and protector.\n\nUntil he's able to find a way home, Lizel figures this is a perfect opportunity to explore a new way of life adventuring as part of a guild. After all, he's sure he'll go home eventually... might as well enjoy the otherworldly vacation for now!\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)", "background": "", "season": "winter", "year": 2026, "broadcast": {"day": "Thursdays", "time": "00:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Thursdays at 00:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 1988, "type": "anime", "name": "TO Books", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1988/TO_Books"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 118, "type": "anime", "name": "SynergySP", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/118/SynergySP"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 36, "type": "anime", "name": "Slice of Life", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}}
