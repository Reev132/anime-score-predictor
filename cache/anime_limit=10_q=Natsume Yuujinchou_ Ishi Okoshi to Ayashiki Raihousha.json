His most important ally is still his gluttonous and sake-loving bodyguard, the arrogant but fiercely protective wolf spirit Madara\u2014or Nyanko-sensei, as Madara is called when in his usual disguise of an unassuming, pudgy cat.\n\nNatsume, while briefly separated from Nyanko-sensei, is ambushed and kidnapped by a strange group of masked, monkey-like youkai, who have spirited him away to their forest as they desperately search for the Book of Friends. Realizing that his \"servant\" has been taken out from right under his nose, Nyanko-sensei enlists the help of Natsume's youkai friends and mounts a rescue operation. However, the forest of the monkey spirits holds many dangerous enemies, including the Matoba Clan, Natsume's old nemesis.\n\nStretching from the formidable hideout of the Matoba to Natsume's own childhood home, Natsume Yuujinchou Shi is a sweeping but familiar return to a world of danger and friendship, where Natsume will finally confront the demons of his own past.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "winter", "year": 2012, "broadcast": {"day": "Tuesdays", "time": "01:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Tuesdays at 01:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 16, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Tokyo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"}, {"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}, {"mal_id": 139, "type": "anime", "name": "Nihon Ad Systems", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/139/Nihon_Ad_Systems"}, {"mal_id": 148, "type": "anime", "name": "Hakusensha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/148/Hakusensha"}, {"mal_id": 757, "type": "anime", "name": "Sony Music Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/757/Sony_Music_Entertainment"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 372, "type": "anime", "name": "NIS America", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/372/NIS_America"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 112, "type": "anime", "name": "Brain's Base", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/112/Brains_Base"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 36, "type": "anime", "name": "Slice of Life", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}, {"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 63, "type": "anime", "name": "Iyashikei", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/63/Iyashikei"}, {"mal_id": 6, "type": "anime", "name": "Mythology", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 25, "type": "anime", "name": "Shoujo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}]}, {"mal_id": 32983, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/32983/Natsume_Yuujinchou_Go", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/81755.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/81755t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/81755l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/81755.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/81755t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/81755l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Natsume Yuujinchou Go"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Natsume Yuujinchou Season 5"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Natsume's Book of Friends Five"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u590f\u76ee\u53cb\u4eba\u5e33 \u4f0d"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Natsume's Book of Friends Season 5"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Natsume Yujin-cho 5"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Natsume Yujin-cho 5"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Natsume Yujin-cho 5"}], "title": "Natsume Yuujinchou Go", "title_english": "Natsume's Book of Friends Season 5", "title_japanese": "\u590f\u76ee\u53cb\u4eba\u5e33 \u4f0d", "title_synonyms": ["Natsume Yuujinchou Season 5", "Natsume's Book of Friends Five"], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 11, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2016-10-05T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2016-12-21T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 5, "month": 10, "year": 2016}, "to": {"day": 21, "month": 12, "year": 2016}}, "string": "Oct 5, 2016 to Dec 21, 2016"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 8.56, "scored_by": 82495, "rank": 122, "popularity": 1339, "members": 203144, "favorites": 897, "synopsis": "Blessed with eyes that are able to perceive the otherwise invisible youkai, Takashi Natsume hides his ability from his newfound family and friends to protect everyone's peaceful daily life.

However, Natsume firmly rejects the clan's invitation since not all exorcists are as reasonable as his friend Shuuichi Natori, and many improperly and indiscriminately seal away every youkai in their way.

Luckily, he is rescued by a traveling youkai couple who make sake cups for a living. Taking a sip of water from one, Natsume feels a surge of energy rush throughout his body, thanks to the \"One Night Cup.\" It is a special cup that makes every drink delicious, but unfortunately, its effects last only for one night. The following day, Natsume attends the youkai banquet with his loyal protector, the sake-loving chubby cat Madara, and gets the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to learn how to make sake cups.\n\nParty of Fun &amp; Games\nNatsume is filled with regret after hastily declining a rare invitation to a banquet from Madara. Curious, he chases after the cat to an old, run-down mansion but soon enough feels the uncanny presence of numerous youkai nearby. When he runs into the seductive youkai Hinoe, she explains that the empty estate serves as a hide-and-seek playground where the winning spirit acquires authority over a valley. With still no trace of Madara, Natsume starts having eerie dreams of the mansion, but this time as the game's participant.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 1119, "type": "anime", "name": "Shuka", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1119/Shuka"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 36, "type": "anime", "name": "Slice of Life", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}, {"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 63, "type": "anime", "name": "Iyashikei", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/63/Iyashikei"}, {"mal_id": 6, "type": "anime", "name": "Mythology", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 25, "type": "anime", "name": "Shoujo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}]}]}
