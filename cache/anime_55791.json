Co-starring with them is Aqua's girlfriend, Akane Kurokawa, who plays Touki's fianc\u00e9e, Princess Saya. Due to the fanbase preferring Tsurugi as Touki's love interest, Saya has made fewer and fewer appearances in the manga, making it difficult for Akane to fully immerse herself in the role. Her struggles are compounded by differences between the play's script and the original work\u2014differences that also frustrate Tokyo Blade's author, Abiko Samejima.\n\nAqua, however, is more concerned with his personal goals than he is with the play. He has only one objective in mind: to grow closer to director Toshirou Kindaichi and find out what he knows about Aqua's mother, Ai.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "[Oshi no Ko] 2nd Season was released on Blu-ray and DVD in six volumes from October 25, 2024, to March 26, 2025.", "season": "summer", "year": 2024, "broadcast": {"day": "Wednesdays", "time": "23:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Wednesdays at 23:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 711, "type": "anime", "name": "Delfi Sound", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/711/Delfi_Sound"}, {"mal_id": 1365, "type": "anime", "name": "Shueisha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"}, {"mal_id": 1422, "type": "anime", "name": "CyberAgent", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1422/CyberAgent"}, {"mal_id": 1696, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 95, "type": "anime", "name": "Doga Kobo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/95/Doga_Kobo"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 72, "type": "anime", "name": "Reincarnation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/72/Reincarnation"}, {"mal_id": 75, "type": "anime", "name": "Showbiz", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/75/Showbiz"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]}}
