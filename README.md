##  Overview

This project analyzes **3000+ anime** from MyAnimeList to uncover patterns in what makes anime successful. Through comprehensive data analysis and visualization, I identified key factors influencing anime ratings and built a predictive model to forecast scores for new anime.

**Project Goals:**
1. Perform in-depth exploratory data analysis on anime characteristics
2. Identify statistical relationships between features and ratings
3. Create data visualization to present findings
4. Build a machine learning model to predict scores of unreleased anime
5. Deploy an accessible, simple web interface for predictions

##  Data Analysis Highlights

### Dataset Overview
- **3000+ anime** collected from MyAnimeList via Jikan API
- **150+ features** engineered from raw data
- **Score range:** 2.23 - 9.29 (10-point scale)
- **Time period:** 1960s - 2025
- **Types:** TV, Movies, OVAs, ONAs, Specials

- ### Analysis Process

- #### 1. **Data Collection Strategy**
Implemented a multi-faceted collection approach to ensure dataset quality:

```
 Top-rated anime     --→ Capture excellent examples
 Seasonal anime      --→ Time-based patterns
️ Genre-base          --→ Comprehensive genre coverage
 Score ranges        --→ Balanced distribution
 Popularity tiers    --→ Different audience sizes
 Type diversity      --→ Format variations
 Random sampling     --→ Unbiased diversity
```

**Key Metric:** Minimum 100 users scored per anime (ensures statistical validity)

#### 2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- Missing value analysis and imputation strategies
- Outlier detection using IQR method
- Duplicate removal (by MAL ID)
- Data type standardization
- Text preprocessing for genres/studios

#### 3. **Feature Engineering**
Created meaningful features through domain knowledge:

**Temporal Features:**
- `anime_age`: Years since release
- `is_recent`: Released within last 5 years
- Seasonal patterns (winter, spring, summer, fall)

**Engagement Metrics:**
- `engagement_rate`: scored_by / members ratio
- Popularity tiers (Top, High, Medium, Low)
- Favorites-to-members ratio

**Content Features:**
- 50+ binary genre indicators
- 20 top studio indicators
- Episode categorization (Short, Standard, Long, Very Long)
- Source material encoding (Manga, Light Novel, Original, etc.)
